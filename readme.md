# AmigosCode "*Getting Started With Spring Boot*" course

codes as I follow through the course.

## Deviations from the tutorial

changes are listed on a per-chapter basis

### Spring Initializr

- used `MariaDB` instead of `PostgreSQL` Driver

I have MariaDB on my local dev environment already set up.

- Gave the `amigoscodespringboot` name instead of demo, group changed from `com.example` to `valdezet`

### Open Project with IntelliJ 

- following through with *Community Edition* instead of *Ultimate Edition*

### Starting the Server

- instead of the IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition Spring Boot Application run feature, I made a maven configuration to run `spring-boot:run` via `mvnw`
